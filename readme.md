# DeluxeMCDev GitHub Organization

Welcome to the DeluxeMCDev GitHub Organization! Here you will find all the resources needed to set up and customize your anarchy server. Explore our repositories below to find the tools and modifications that best suit your needs.

## Repositories

### [AnarchyCore](https://github.com/DeluxeMCDev/AnarchyCore)

**Customization:** Modify the `tab_header` and `tab_footer` variables in the main class to personalize your server's appearance. If you need help, feel free to reach out to admin@deluxemc.net for guidance.

**Compatibility:** This plugin targets Folia due to its regionalized threading, which ensures better performance and stability compared to Paper, Spigot, or CraftBukkit.

### [Server](https://github.com/DeluxeMCDev/Server)

**Customization:** Use these files to set up your DeluxeMC anarchy server. For adjustments to the DeluxeMC tab and URL, please visit our AnarchyCore plugin repository.

**Server Details:** Our server runs on Paper Folia as part of a BungeeCord network. For those not using BungeeCord, removal is simple: edit `spigot.yml` and change `bungeecord: true` to `bungeecord: false`. Also, remove the Fallback Server Addon from the plugins folder.

**Security:** Ensure server security using IP Tables or UFW. If using the Pterodactyl panel, set up a local allocation using the containerâ€™s local IP.

### [Alternatives](https://github.com/DeluxeMCDev/Alternatives)

While DeluxeMC is a modern solution for Anarchy Servers utilizing the Folia Software, which may not always be stable, we recommend checking out Kaboom for a customizable alternative. Kaboom is an open-source option originally designed for Free OP Anarchy servers but can be modified to withhold OP privileges from players.
